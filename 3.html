I love you
<br>With every guitar string scar on my hand
<br>I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
<br>My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
<br>All's well that ends well to end up with you
<br>Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
<br>And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
<br>And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover
<br>Can I go where you go?
<br>Can we always be this close forever and ever?
<br>And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
<br>You're my, my, my, my
<br>Oh, you're my, my, my, my
<br>Darling, you're my, my, my, my
<br><strong>Lover</strong>


<h3><br>He is cute and smart.<br></h3>
